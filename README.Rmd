[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Nowosad/popgrids.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Nowosad/popgrids)
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/119410715.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/119410715)

This dataset consists 0.5 × 0.5 degree grids of: 

1. Global population and GDP estimations for years 1980-2010 created by downscaling actual populations and GDPs by country, and
2. Global population and GDP projections for years 2020-2100 created by downscaling projected populations and GDPs under three shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP): SSP1; SSP2; and SSP3.

The dataset is modified [Global dataset of gridded population and GDP scenarios, version 3](http://www.cger.nies.go.jp/gcp/population-and-gdp.html). 
While the original dataset is a shapefile of 0.5 × 0.5 degree grids masked by countries, the new one contains a regular grid in form of raster objects.

Code used to create this data is at https://github.com/Nowosad/global_population_and_gdp.

## Installation

Get the development version from github:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Nowosad/popgrids")
```

## Examples

```{r example}
library(popgrids)
library(sp)
library(raster)
```

#### Population estimation for 2010

```{r example1}
plot(pop_grid, "p_2010")
```

#### GDPs projections for 2100 (pathway SSP3)

```{r example2}
plot(gdp_grid, "g3_2100")
```
