Description: This dataset consists 0.5 × 0.5 degree grids of: 
    (1) Global population and GDP estimations for years 1980-2010 created by
    downscaling actual populations and GDPs by country, and
    (2) Global population and GDP projections for years 2020-2100 created by
    downscaling projected populations and GDPs under 
    three shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP): SSP1; SSP2; and SSP3.
    The dataset is modified Global dataset of gridded population and GDP scenarios, 
    version 3 (<http://www.cger.nies.go.jp/gcp/population-and-gdp.html>). 
    While the original dataset is a shapefile of 0.5 × 0.5 degree grids masked by countries, 
    the new one contains a regular grid in form of raster objects.
